# Analyzing Data with Pandas and Visualizing Results with Matplotlib

## Overview

This project focuses on loading, exploring, analyzing, and visualizing a dataset using **Pandas** for data manipulation, **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization, and **Scikit-learn** to load a sample dataset (the Iris dataset). The project also includes basic error handling to ensure the code runs smoothly even when unexpected issues arise.

## Objectives

- To load a dataset and clean the data using **Pandas**.
- To perform basic data analysis (compute summary statistics, group by categories, etc.).
- To create different visualizations (line chart, bar chart, histogram, scatter plot).
- To handle potential errors during the file reading process.

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset
- The Iris dataset is loaded using **sklearn.datasets.load_iris()**.
- The dataset is then inspected using `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.isnull()` to check for missing values and data types.
- Missing values are handled using `df.fillna()`.

### Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
- Basic summary statistics of numerical columns are calculated using `.describe()`.
- The dataset is grouped by the `species` column, and the mean of numerical columns for each species is computed using `groupby()`.

### Task 3: Data Visualization
- The following visualizations are created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:
  - Line chart showing trends over the index of the dataset.
  - Bar chart comparing the average sepal length for each species.
  - Histogram showing the distribution of the `sepal length (cm)`.
  - Scatter plot visualizing the relationship between `sepal length` and `petal length`.

### Task 4: Error Handling
- A try-except block is implemented to handle errors during file loading, including file not found or empty file errors.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries by running the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
How to Run the Code

python analyze_data.py
Expected Output
The code will generate:

Summary statistics of the dataset.

Grouped data based on the species.

Four different types of visualizations:
